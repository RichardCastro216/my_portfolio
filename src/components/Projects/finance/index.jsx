            <br></br>
            <p style={{fontFamily:'Times New Roman'}}>This was before the proliferation of smartphone based wallets. The thinking was that most people in India with smartphones did not access their banking / financial information from their mobile device because of a perceived lack of information security.</p>

            <h3 style={{fontFamily:'Times New Roman'}}>THE OPPORTUNITY</h3>
            <br></br>
            <p style={{fontFamily:'Times New Roman'}}>SAP Labs India ran a program called the "Billion User Initiative" which aimed at disrupting emerging markets like India with new and relevant products. All major Indian banks send transaction confirmations through SMS. The idea was - What if we could enable consumers to see their financial information on a smartphone app without having to connect with internet banking credentials.</p>

              <p style={{fontFamily:'Times New Roman'}}>The project did not really have a significant research budget and was in a 'proof of concept' mode. However, I decided that it was necessary to get brief insights into how people managed their finances before any other activity. I conducted a survey to achieve this. 
              The results of the survey proved that the hypothesis behind the idea was sound and the opportunity existed. It was clear it had to be an Android based app, as most participants used Android phones.</p>

              <p style={{fontFamily:'Times New Roman'}}>1.Debit card was the most often used mode of spending, which meant people received SMS notifications for those transactions.</p>
              <br></br>
              <p style={{fontFamily:'Times New Roman'}}>2.People were reluctant to add transactions manually and automated parsing of SMSs was perceived to be clever.</p>
